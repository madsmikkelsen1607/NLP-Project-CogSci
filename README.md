# NLP-Project-CogSci
The project in which this readme is in, is a project about predicting genre-labels of song lyrics using TF-IDF and linear regression models.

The code for the project was ran in uCloud, a cloud computing service. To run the code yourself, you will need to open the notebook file in the src folder called project.ipynb 
This chunks in the notebook can be run sequentially to run the code for the project, though this is computationally quite expensive. Some chunks that create plots or save models can be skipped, and there will be comments to notify you of this throughout the code.



To ensure everything runs as intended, it is recommended you create a new virtual environment based on the requirements.txt file within this repository, which includes all packages used for the project. Using an IDE such as VScode, you will automatically be prompted by the IDE when creating a new venv to use for a file.

All plots and figures used in the paper can be found in the plots folder, while the artifacts folder contains the saved TF-IDF and final model, the linearSVC
